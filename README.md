# Cardano Treasury Overview

The efficient management of Cardano project treasuries is crucial to sustaining the growth and development of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. There is a lack of tools and services to allow projects to establish fully transparent and accessible treasury & accounting systems.

The Treasury Guild aims to offer direct services and tools to Projects in the early stages of their emergence and where treasury management can be outsourced to trusted people.

There are three components:&#x20;

* Treasury Management System
* Accounting Services
* Treasury dApps and tools
